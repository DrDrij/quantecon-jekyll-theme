# 2017 PhD Workshops on Computational Methods


In September 2017, [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) is running a series of workshops for PhD students in US economics programs.

Please sign up [here](https://goo.gl/forms/vB1lVobzxfHhAg4g1).

### Outline

The workshops will provide an overview of modern open source tools and techniques for computational modeling, loosely based on the material in  [Lectures in Quantitative Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/).

All economics PhDs and faculty may attend, subject to seating space only. Workshops are free but please be sure to [register](http://goo.gl/forms/Lq0t6gPzDoPbh3JJ3) if you plan to participate.

Workshops will be hands on so please be sure to bring your laptop!  

The workshop series is supported by the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/).

*   [Visualization](https://matplotlib.org/) and [data analysis](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
*   [Just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation)
*   Parallel programming and other aspects of [high performance computing](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/)
*   [Cloud computing](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions) and remote infrastructure

### Instructions

Please be sure to bring your laptop to the workshop.  If possible,

*   For session 1 install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (version 3.6) 

    *   Please follow the instructions on [this page](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/getting_started.html)
*   For session 2 install [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads)

    *   Please follow the instructions on [this page](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started.html)

All languages and computing platforms we use are free and open source.  

Troubleshooting of installations and other software issues will be available in the first session.
