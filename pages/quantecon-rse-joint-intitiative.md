# QuantEcon RSE Joint Intitiative

The QuantEcon RSE Joint Initiative (QRJI) is a collaboration between the QuantEcon project and computational researchers at the Research School of Economics, Australian National University.  

QRJI will support research and teaching in computational economics through the provision of resources and training, as well as software and computational expertise for policy making, econometric modeling and quantitative research.

QuantEcon also engages talented students from RSE as research assistants, developing economics graduates with strong computational skills.

As with QuantEcon, all software developed by QRJI is open source. The QRJI computational labs are located in the Copland Building.
