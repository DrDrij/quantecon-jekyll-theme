# Resources for Developers

## Introduction

If you are new to open source development, here is some information to help you get started.

Contributions to QuantEcon should follow the canonical open source pattern, via forking the code libraries and sending pull requests. If youâ€™re not familiar with this kind of development there are many useful tutorials lying around, including

1.  [The GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)

2.  [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/)

3.  [Pull request ettiquette](http://readwrite.com/2014/07/02/github-pull-request-etiquette)

QuantEcon follows standard best practice coding protocols, such as unit testing and continuous integration. Read on for specific information on development protocols for each language.
