# 2018 Summer School on Structural Dynamic Models 

[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) will run a one-day workshop at the [Summer School on Structural Dynamic Models](http://www.econ.ku.dk/cce/events/summerschool/), to be held on May 28th 2018 at the University of Copenhagen. The sessions will provide an overview of modern open source tools and techniques for computational modeling, loosely based on the material in [Lectures in Quantitative Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/).

### Schedule

*   9:00 - 10:30: Introduction to QuantEcon, Jupyter notebooks, and Python
*   10:45 - 12:15: Python for data handling, analysis, and visualisation, numerical techniques
