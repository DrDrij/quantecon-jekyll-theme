# Get Involved

QuantEcon is developed [by the community for the community](about.md) and contributions are welcome. There are several ways you can get involved.

## Join the Discourse forum

You can reach out to the [QuantEcon team](team.md) via the [Discourse forum](http://discourse.quantecon.org/). The forum is a good place to ask questions, get guidance on contributing to the project, or request new lectures or library features.

## Donate

QuantEcon is sponsored by [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), a U.S. 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software.

Through NumFOCUS, QuantEcon can receive tax-deductible donations to help support ongoing development. Your donations will go towards:

*   developing and facilitating the development of open source software for economic modeling, and
*   building open, collaborative platforms for sharing, discussing and documenting open source software

To support the QuantEcon project:

*   [Donate directly](http://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NjY5OA==) via Flipcause
*   Shop in our [merchandise store](store.md), featuring hoodies, t-shirts, and more

## Develop and contribute code

Wewelcome submission of algorithms and high quality code to [QuantEcon.py](quantecon-py.md) and [QuantEcon.jl](quantecon-jl.md) on all topics in quantitative economics.

*   Information on contributing to [QuantEcon.py](quantecon-py.md) is found [here](python-developers.md)

*   Information on contributing to [QuantEcon.jl](quantecon-jl.md) is found [here](julia-developers.md)

Less experienced developers who wish to get involved can help improve documentation, work on smaller enhancements or report bugs and request features.

## Write a notebook

If you’ve written code related to quantitative economics and want to share it with the community, we encourage you to submit it as a Jupyter notebook to [QuantEcon Notes](https://notes.quantecon.org/).

## Resources

If you’re new to open source development, here is some information to help you get started.

Contributions to the QuantEcon library should follow the standard open source pattern in regards to forking the code libraries and sending pull requests on GitHub. If you’re not familiar with this kind of development there are many useful tutorials lying around, including:

*   [The GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)

*   [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/)

*   [Pull request etiquette](http://readwrite.com/2014/07/02/github-pull-request-etiquette)
