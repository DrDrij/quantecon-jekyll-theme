As part of the [QuantEcon-RSEÂ Joint Initiative](https://quantecon.org/quantecon-rse-joint-intitiative) at Australian National University, the QuantEcon lab space in the Copland building is being updated and refurnished. Pictured below are new signs outside Room 1130 in the Copland building. The room houses several QuantEcon research assistants and visitors, and is welcome to be used by faculty members in computational economics.
