We’ve added a [notebook gallery](http://quantecon.org/notebooks.html) to the [QuantEcon](http://quantecon.org/index.html) organization site in order to collect interesting [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) related to quantitative economics. Please feel free to submit your notebook for possible inclusion. Instructions are available on the [notebook page](http://quantecon.org/notebooks.html).
