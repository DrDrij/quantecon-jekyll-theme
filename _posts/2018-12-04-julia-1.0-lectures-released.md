As part of the move to Julia 1.0, QuantEcon lectures in Julia have been significantly revised and are now co-authored with [Jesse Perla](http://jesseperla.com/) at the University of British Columbia. QuantEcon welcomes Jesse and his team to the project, and is excited about the changes on the Julia side.

Improvements include: 

*   The addition of many new lectures, for example on [version control with GitHub](http://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/version_control.html) and [generic programming in Julia](http://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/generic_programming.html).
*   An update to the [Julia cheatsheet](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/julia-cheatsheet.html).
*   The creation and use of new QuantEcon packages, such as [Expectations.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/Expectations.jl) and [InstantiateFromURL.jl](http://github.com/QuantEcon/InstantiateFromURL.jl).
*   The integration (and development) of outside packages such as [Parameters.jl](https://github.com/mauro3/Parameters.jl), [NLsolve.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/NLsolve.jl), and [Optim.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl), which we used to write clearer and faster code.  
*   An overhaul of the infrastructure used to build and deliver the lectures.

We are thankful to [Arnav Sood](http://arnavsood.com/), and [Jose Calderon](https://jbsc.netlify.com/) for their work on the content side, and [Matt McKay](https://github.com/mmcky) for the build infrastructure. Also thanks to [Kaan Yolsever](http://github.com/yolsever), [Adam Jozefiak](http://github.com/ajozefiak), [Xiaojun Guan](http://github.com/xiaojunguan) and [Pooya Ravari](http://github.com/pooyafa) for their research assistance on this project.
