[This notebook](https://notes.quantecon.org/submission/5bb58d1e11611400157fdc8d) shows how to solve the [Krusell-Smith](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/250034) model using the Euler equation method in Julia, in addition to replicating an example from [Maliar, Maliar, and Valli](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188909001328). Solving the model yields the aggregate law of motion for capital.
