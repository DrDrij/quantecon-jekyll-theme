A new lecture extending [Markov Perfect Equilibrium](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/markov_perf.html) and [Robustness](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/robustness.html) lectures has been added to the Python side [here](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/rob_markov_perf.html). The lecture was co-authored by Doncheng Zou. The lecture produces plots that compare previous results to the model with robust decision rules; the new model features a higher price path and lower output path. Additionally, the lecture considers equilibrium effects when firms have heterogenous beliefs about output and price.
