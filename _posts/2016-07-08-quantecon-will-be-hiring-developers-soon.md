As mentioned in an earlier news item, [QuantEcon](http://quantecon.org/index.html) has received a large new grant from the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/). Among other things, the grant will allow us to hire a postdoctoral fellow, a pre-doctoral fellow, part time web developers and many new RAs. We will be looking for highly talented programmers with experience using Python, Julia and other open source tools. Formal announcements will go out shortly. In the meantime, please feel free to send your CV and informal expressions of interest to [contact@quantecon.org](mailto:contact%40quantecon.org).
