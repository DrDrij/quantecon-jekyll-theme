You can now open a lecture as a Jupyter notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), allowing code to be run and edited live in the cloud. Simply click the 'Run Notebook' button in the top left-hand corner to launch the notebook in Colab (you will need to be signed in with a Google account).

Colab is a free service provided by Google that runs in your browser -- requiring no local installation. The majority of libraries used in our lectures come pre-installed in Colab -- the remaining libraries are installed with a pip command at the start of the lecture.
