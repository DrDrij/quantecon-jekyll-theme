title: "Pathways for QuantEcon Lectures"
author: Natasha Watkins
excerpt: Our lectures site now features separate pathways for undergraduate and graduate students.
---

We have added tabs to the [table of contents](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/)Â (also on the [julia side](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/)) on the lectures site that allow students to select material suited to either undergraduate or graduate level. Additionally, we have refined our lectures listing, with new categories for [dynamic programming](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index_dynamic_programming.html) and [time series](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index_time_series_models.html) models.
