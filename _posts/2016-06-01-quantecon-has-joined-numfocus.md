Along with several collaborators, we have created an organization called [QuantEcon](http://quantecon.org/index.html) to coordinate developement and documentation of open source software for economists. This lecture site now falls under the QuantEcon umbrella, as a QuantEcon sponsored project. QuantEcon has been accepted as a member of [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/), a nonprofit that supports open source scientific software development. Other members of NumFOCUS include [IPython](http://ipython.org/), [Julia](http://julialang.org/), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). QuantEcon is run for the benefit of the economics community, and contributions of code, documentation, ideas or developer time are most welcome. The [QuantEcon website](http://quantecon.org/index.html) provides information for anyone who would like to get involved.
