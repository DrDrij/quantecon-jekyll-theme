We have published a new lecture titled [The Need for Speed](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/need_for_speed.html) on the Julia side of the website. The lecture covers how to write high performance code by using Julia's just in time compilation, type inference, and multiple dispatch features. This lecture follows on from an earlier Julia lecture, [Types, Methods and Dispatch](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/types_methods.html).
