Every [QuantEcon lecture](https://lectures.quantecon.org/) now features a button like the one shown above that enables you to download code from the lecture in a Jupyter notebook. The notebooks are generated using [Jupinx](https://medium.com/quantecon-blog/introducing-jupinx-60ba9fc12f4f), a tool we released late last year to convert reStructuredText files (the format we write our lectures in) to Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks are [tested daily](https://quantecon.org/news-item/code-testing-lecture-site) and therefore should run sequentially without errors. You can check the execution status of notebooks [here](https://lectures.quantecon.org/status.html).
