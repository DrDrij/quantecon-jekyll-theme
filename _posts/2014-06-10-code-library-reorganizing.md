The past few weeks have been spent reorganizing the code library, combining the most useful programs into a package called QuantEcon. In practice this means that you can now `import quantecon as qe`, in just the same way that you `import numpy as np`. The package can be found on [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quantecon/. Details and installation instructions can be found [here](http://quantecon.org/python_index.html).

Like the great majority of Python libraries, QuantEcon is open source and we welcome contributions of high quality code for solving important economic models.
