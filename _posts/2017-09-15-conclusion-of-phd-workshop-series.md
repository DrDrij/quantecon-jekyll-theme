author: Natasha Watkins
excerpt: The final PhD workshop for computational economics was held at UC San Diego.
---

QuantEcon finished its [PhD workshop series](https://quantecon.org/2017-phd-workshops-on-computational-methods) at UC San Diego today. Overall, we had close to 400 registrations for the workshops at 8 different universities in the United States. Workshop attendees were introduced to Jupyter notebooks, open source programming in Python and Julia, and computational methods for economics. We hope the workshops will encourage new PhD students to use open source tools in their studies. Material from the workshops can be found [here](https://github.com/QuantEcon/phd_workshops).
