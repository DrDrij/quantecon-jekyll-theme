Congratulations to QuantEcon pre-doctoral fellow [Natasha Watkins](https://github.com/natashawatkins), who has been accepted to the PhD program at UCLA in 2019! Natasha has been a key part of the QuantEcon team since March 2017, following a year at the Reserve Bank of Australia. During her time, she has contributed lectures including [Linear Regression in Python](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/ols.html) and [Maximum Likelihood Estimation](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/mle.html), and assisted running [workshops](workshops.md) in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, China and the US. We are delighted to see her continuing her studies in economics and look forward to future contributions to the QuantEcon project!
