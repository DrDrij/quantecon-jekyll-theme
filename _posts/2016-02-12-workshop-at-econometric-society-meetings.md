On June 16 we’ll be running a workshop based around quant-econ.net at the [North American summer meeting of the Econometric Society](http://sites.sas.upenn.edu/nasm-2016/). The workshop will provide a quick start introduction to programming in Python and Julia for economists. The target audience is economists with some experience with programming in Matlab, Stata or similar, who are curious about Python and Julia, and how they might be useful for research in quantitative economics. The [workshop page](http://quantecon.org/econometric_society_workshop.html) contains further details.
