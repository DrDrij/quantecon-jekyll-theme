excerpt: We have added a new lecture on the endogenous grid method for policy iteration
---

We have added a new lecture (in both [Python](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/egm_policy_iter.html) and [Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/egm_policy_iter.html)) on the endogenous grid method for policy iteration. The EGM algorithm, invented by [Chris Carroll](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/), results in significant speed improvements over [Coleman policy function iteration](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/coleman_policy_iter.html).
