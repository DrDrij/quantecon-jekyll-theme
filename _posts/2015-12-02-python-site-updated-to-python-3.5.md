The entire Python side of the website has now been updated to Python 3.5, along with all code examples. Our build environment is based on the latest Python 3.5 version of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda). Apart from all the other goodies, this environment includes the `@` operator for matrix multiplication, which comes with NumPy 1.10 and above.
