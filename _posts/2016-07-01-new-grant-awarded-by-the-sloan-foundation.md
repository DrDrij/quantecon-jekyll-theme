We are delighted to announce that [QuantEcon](http://quantecon.org/index.html) has received a very generous additional round of funding from the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/). The grant will support many new and existing activities over the coming years. Along with further development of the lecture site and code libraries, we have major plans for revamping the [notebook gallery](http://quantecon.org/notebooks.html) in order to make it more interactive, for building new code libraries, and for supporting a variety of open source scientific projects based around Python and Julia.
