The latest release of [QuantEcon.py](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py) implements the [Abreu and Sannikov algorithm](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/433) for solving games efficiently, as demonstrated in [this notebook](http://notes.quantecon.org/submission/5bfceaca18ada9000f1ec61b). We have also added a just-in-time compiled [Nelder-Mead algorithm](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/441) for multivariate optimization. Thanks to [Zejin Shi](https://github.com/shizejin) and [Quentin Batista](https://github.com/QBatista), among others, for their work on this release.
