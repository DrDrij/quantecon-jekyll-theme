A Julia version of the Aiyagari lecture [has been added](http://quant-econ.net/jl/aiyagari.html) to the site. The code was written by NYU PhD student [Victoria Gregory](https://github.com/vgregory757). We are also grateful to contributions from [Maximilian Huber](https://github.com/MaximilianJHuber) and [Spencer Lyon](https://github.com/sglyon).
