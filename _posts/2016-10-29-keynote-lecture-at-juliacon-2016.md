A few months ago one of us (the one who’s better at fly fishing) gave a lecture on macroeconomics and computational methods at [JuliaCon](http://juliacon.org/). The video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKBwJkYgVk). The talk provides a quick overview of the state of modern macroeconomics. It is aimed at a general audience with a background in computation, but will likely be of interest to some economists as well. Discussion centers on formation of beliefs and expectations, modeling of markets and technologies, and associated computational challenges.
