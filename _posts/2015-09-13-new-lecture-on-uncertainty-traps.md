excerpt: A new lecture on uncertainty traps has been added to the the Python side
---

A [new lecture](http://quant-econ.net/py/uncertainty_traps.html) on uncertainty traps has been added to the the Python side of quant-econ.net. (Hopefully we’ll get a Julia version up before too long.) The lecture studies a simplified version of a very interesting model due to [Pablo Fajgelbaum](http://economics.ucla.edu/person/pablo-fajgelbaum/), [Edouard Schaal](https://sites.google.com/site/edouardschaal/), and [Mathieu Taschereau-Dumouchel](http://www.mathtd.com/). The model shows how self-reinforcing uncertainty can have large impacts on economic activity.
