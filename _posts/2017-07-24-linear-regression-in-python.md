A new lecture covering [linear regression in Python](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/ols.html) has been added. The lecture uses the Python packages [statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) and [linearmodels](https://github.com/bashtage/linearmodels) to replicate results from Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson's [paper](https://economics.mit.edu/files/4123), 'The colonial origins of comparative development'. We have also rearranged our lectures [index](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index.html) on the Python side, and expect to add more content to the Data and Empirics section in the near future.
