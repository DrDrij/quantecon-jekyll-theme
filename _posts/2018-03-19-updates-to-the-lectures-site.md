title: "Updates to the lectures site"
author: Natasha Watkins
excerpt: We have a new McCall job search lecture that introduces dynamic programming, and a revised table of contents for the lecture site.
---

Due to our growing number of lectures, we have revised the table of contents ([python](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/) / [julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/)) into more specific topics such as dynamic programming and time series.

Additionally, we have split our original McCall Search Model lecture into two parts. The [first lecture](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/mccall_model.html) ([julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/mccall_model.html)[ version](http://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/mccall_model.html)) uses a basic McCall model to introduce learners to dynamic programming. [Part II](http://lectures.quantecon.org/py/mccall_model_with_separation.html) ([julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/mccall_model_with_separation.html)[ version](http://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/mccall_model_with_separation.html)) extends this model to include job separation.

These changes are a part of our effort to accommodate less advanced users of our website --- more changes are to come.
