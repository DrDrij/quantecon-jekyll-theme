An additional [lecture on Pandas](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/pandas_panel.html) has been added that covers more advanced functions such as merging, grouping, and using multiindices. Pandas is a powerful Python package that contains useful tools for working with large and complicated datasets. The lecture specifically focuses on techniques useful for working with panel data, with applications to datasets from the OECD and Eurostat.
