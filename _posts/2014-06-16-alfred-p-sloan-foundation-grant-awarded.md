We are delighted to announce that the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/) has awarded quant-econ a very generous and helpful grant to support its development. The grant will allow us to spend a large amount of time working together over the coming years, with the objective of building up the code libraries and adding many new applications in all fields of economics and econometrics. It will also fund travel, workshops and conference presentations, and allow us to employ a postdoctoral fellow and a number of research assistants.

We feel very fortunate to be partnering with the outstanding team at the Sloan Foundation, and look forward to seeing quant-econ develop into a important resource for all economists.
