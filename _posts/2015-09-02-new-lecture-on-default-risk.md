We have added a [new lecture](http://quant-econ.net/py/arellano.html) on the Python side on default risk and income fluctuations. The lecture computes versions of [Cristina Arellano’s](http://www.cristinaarellano.com/)popular and important model of sovereign default. A Julia version of the lecture should be out in the next few days.
