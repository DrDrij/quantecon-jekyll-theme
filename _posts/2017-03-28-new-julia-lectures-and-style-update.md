You can now find three new lectures on the Julia side of QuantEcon lectures covering [Globalization and Cycles](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/matsuyama.html), [Coleman Policy Iteration](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/coleman_policy_iter.html), and the [Lake Model](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/lake_model.html). Additionally, the lecturesâ€™ style has been refreshed to make reading code input and output simpler.
